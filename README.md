Hello Everyone!

I am MrPixelTick.
This is my first project i am working on that is open source in github.
And i have made an open source discord bot with Discord.PY
Well the code was not all from me because i was coding with my friend hoydra[https://github.com/hoydra]/Hydra4179

So now about the bot.
The bot is about making you learn code.
It has alot of features like Docs! Docs will give you a link of the docs you need well Python is only supported.
Almost all of the bot is made with embeds for it to look better.
Well the bot has bad things too. Because not everything is always perfect.
Soo the bad things are that the bot is only in [Beta] and this bot can be removed later.

So now how do you use it.
The answer is simple! The prefix is [!] and if you need to know the commands you can use [!help]. Also there will be a command where you can change the prefix for the bot later.

And now the final question. How do you set it up?
--Installing--
0.Install Python At [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe]
1.You download this code
2.You open [main.py]
3.You delete the line that says [token = os.environ['token']] This can be found at the top of the code in #Variables
--Creating A Bot--
4.You go on Discord's Developer Portal [https://discord.com/developers/applications]
5.You make an application
6.You add a picture for the bot and a description [ You dont need to do this ]
7.You go to side and go to the Bot part
8.Click [Create-Bot]
9.Click [Yes do it!]
10.Now you will see a token close to the description and the profile picture [ Warning : Do NOT share your token to anyone because it can give hackers access to your bot ]
--Final Touches--
11.Go back to [main.py]
12.Go to the end of the [main.py] file.
13.You will see a [client.run(token)]
14.Change the [(token)] part with [("8HIDFYHL4KN88") The random numbers and letters is just an example of where you should put your token in.
--Inviting The Bot--
15.Go back to Discord's Developer Portal [https://discord.com/developers/applications]
16.Go to your application
17.Go to OAuth2
18.At the bottom you will see scopes and there you have to select [bot] in the center of scopes
19.A link will generate but you are still not done so then there will a new same looking window pop up below and then select Administrator
20.Your link is now ready and there you will see at scopes there is a link. Copy It and paste it in your browser.
21.Invite The bot to your server
--Running The Bot--
22.Open [ain.py]with python
My bot is now running on your computer or server.

[OPTIONAL STEPS[Do them if your bot does not work]

If you have bugs with the bot or your bot always crashes try this!
-Removing WebServer-
1.Go to [main.py]
2.Go to the end of the code where you can see [keep_alive()]
3.Select that line and delete it.
4.Go to the start of the code at variables where you can see [from webserver import keep_alive]
4.Select that line and delete it.
5.Delete webserver.py
6.Done!

If you dont have alot of disk space try doing this!
-Removing Logging-
1.Go to [main.py]
2.Go to the part where it says [#Logs]
3.Select the code there from [#Logs] to [logger.addHandler(handler)]
4.Delete that part of the code you selected.
5.Delete the file called discord.log
6.Done!

So Now.
You know the most things about the bot
So i hope you enjoy my bot.
It is a great time while coding bots.
Later i will maybe make even more bots!
And i will try to keep this bot up as much as possible with support.
I am MrPixelTick And
